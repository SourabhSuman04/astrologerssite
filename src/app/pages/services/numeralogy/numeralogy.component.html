      Vedic Numerology is one of the most popular systems of Numerology. It is based on an ancient Indian system that applies special meanings to numbers and their symbols.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      The ancient Indians realized that numbers exist in everything – in nature, time, genes, and even our subconscious mind. Numbers 1–9 have specific meanings in the Vedas, forming the foundation of Vedic Numerology.

        This is why Vedic numerology and other forms of Eastern numerology are so accurate. 
        They recognize that numbers are everywhere in life and their vibrations deeply affect 
        us on both a conscious and unconscious level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Numbers 1-9 have specific meanings in the Vedas. This is where the basic foundation 
        of Vedic numerology began. Over time, more patterns were found in the numbers 1-9 
        and new theories about them were applied in Vedic numerology.

        Number is also a certain vibration, a certain energy. Numbers are the key to 
        understanding human behaviour, they help to reach deeper layers of human personality.

      <p>
        The number helps to determine the personality of a person, his talents, behaviour, 
        hidden obstacles, inner needs.
